# I. Concepts

## 1. Data Structures:

In Python, #data_structures are #containers that organize and group data types together in different ways. Here are a few basic types of data structures:

- **Lists**: A #list is a collection of items that are ordered and #mutable (changeable). They allow duplicate members. Think of a shopping list where you can add, remove or chage items.
- **Tuples**: A #tuple is similar to a list, but it's #immutable (unchangeable). Think of a tuple as a GPS coordinate. The latitude and longitude that define a location on the Earth can't be changed.
- **Sets**: A #set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. Sets don't allow duplicates. Imagine a real-world set like a bag of unique marbles.
- **Dictionaries**: A #dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs that are unordered, changeable, and indexed. It's like an English dictionary, where for every word (the key), there's a definition (the value).

## 2. Control Flow:

#Control_flow is the order in which the program's code executes. Here are some basic control flow concepts:

- **If statements**: #If_statements are used for decision-making operations. They run a specific block of code if a condition is true. If I'm hungry (condition is true), then I'll eat (run a specific block of code).
- **For loops**: #For_loops are used for iterating over a sequence (like #list, #tuple, #dictionary, #set, or #string). It's like when you're going through every item on your shopping list one by one.
- **While loops**: #While_loops keep executing a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. Think of it as listening to your favorite song on repeat, while you're still enjoing them (condition is true).
