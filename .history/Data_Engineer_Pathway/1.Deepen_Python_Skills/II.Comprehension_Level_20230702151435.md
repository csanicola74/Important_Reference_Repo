## A. Python Syntax and Semantics

**1. Syntax:**

Python's syntax refers to the set of rules that dictate how Python programs should be formatted and structured. Let's cover some important elements:

- **Indentation:** Python uses whitespace (space or tab) to denote blocks of code. Other languages often use curly braces `{}` or keywords. If you have a block of code after a colon (such as after defining a function or after an if statement), Python expects the next lines to be indented to a new level until that block of code is done.
- **Comments:** Comments are used to explain what the code does and are ignored by Python. A single line comment begins with a `#`. Multi-line comments begin and end with `'''` or `"""`.
- **Variables:** Variables in Python can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), underscores (\_), or numbers (0-9), but they cannot start with a number. Python is dynamically-typed, meaning you don't need to declare the data type of a variable.
- **Statements:** Python executes instructions one by one, these instructions are known as statements. For example, a = 1 is an assignment statement.

**2. Semantics:**

Semantics refers to the meaning behind the code, that is, how the Python interpreter understands and carries out instructions. Let's touch on some basic concepts:

- **Variables:** When you define a variable in Python, the name points to the value in memory. So when you do `a = 1`, `a` now points to `1` in memory.
- **Functions:** Functions are reusable pieces of code. When you define a function using `def`, you're telling Python that this is a set of instructions it might need to execute multiple times.
- **Objects:** Python is an object-oriented language, which means everything in Python is an object with properties and methods. A string, a list, a dictionary, a function, even an integer, they are all objects.
- **Errors:** If Python encounters an error, it will stop executing and raise an error message. This can happen due to syntax errors (like missing a colon or incorrect indentation) or semantic errors (like trying to divide by zero or referencing a variable that has not been defined).
