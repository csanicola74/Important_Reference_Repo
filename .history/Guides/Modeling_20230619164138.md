# Modeling

## PART I: Creating the Prediction Machine Learning Models

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
```

### Step 2: Load Your **Cleaned and Feature-Engineered Dataset**

_This dataset will come from after running the 'data_cleaning' script first_

> _Most datasets that you will be working with are going to be csv files. If you have an xls file instead, convert it to a csv file first._

- For importing from local files and especially when using 'example.py' files

`df = pd.read_csv('cleaned_and_feature_engineered_healthcare_dataset.csv')`

- For importing from local files but using a Notebook environment, like Jupyter, with files ending in 'example.ipynb'

`df = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/Caroline/Documents/GitHub/reop_name/Data/Raw_Data/cleaned_and_feature_engineered_healthcare_dataset.csv')`

### Step 3: Define Your Input Features and Target

```python
X = df.drop(columns='target')  # Replace 'target' with your target column name
y = df['target']  # Replace 'target' with your target column name
```

### Step 4: Split Your Data into Training and Testing Sets

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 5: Train Your Model

Here we're using a RandomForestRegressor as an example, but you can substitute it with any appropriate model based on your problem.

```python
rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 6: Make Predictions and Evaluate Your Model

```python
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)

# Print RMSE and R-squared for regression tasks
print('Root Mean Squared Error:', np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)))
print('R-squared:', r2_score(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Step 7: Hyperparameter Tuning

You can use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for your model. Here's an example with GridSearchCV:

```python
# Define the hyperparameters and the values you want to test
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [None, 5, 10],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}

# Instantiate GridSearchCV, fit the model, and make predictions
grid_search = GridSearchCV(rf_model, param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_

# Make predictions with the best model and print the evaluation metrics
y_pred_best_model = best_model.predict(X_test)
print('Root Mean Squared Error (Best Model):', np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_best_model)))
print('R-squared (Best Model):', r2_score(y_test, y_pred_best_model))
```

### Step 8: Inspect the Best Hyperparameters

```python
print('Best Hyperparameters:', grid_search.best_params_)
```

Please note that this is a simple and general guideline. Depending on the complexity and nature of the dataset and the problem at hand, you may need to implement more sophisticated pipelines, preprocessing, feature selection, cross-validation, multiple model evaluation, post-processing, etc. Also, remember that the performance of the predictive model is usually proportional to how well the feature engineering and data cleaning steps were conducted.

## PART II: Deploying the Model for Future Predictions

There are a few different ways you could deploy your machine learning model depending on your specific use case and the resources available to you. One common approach is to build a web application that can serve your model. This can be done using frameworks like Flask or Django in Python, which allow you to create routes that can process requests and use your model to make predictions.

### Step 1: Save Your Trained Model

First, you need to save your trained model using a library like joblib or pickle. This allows you to load the model later without having to retrain it.

```python
from joblib import dump

# Assume 'best_model' is the trained model
dump(best_model, 'trained_model.joblib')

```

## Step 2: Create a Flask App

Step 3: Make Requests to Your App
