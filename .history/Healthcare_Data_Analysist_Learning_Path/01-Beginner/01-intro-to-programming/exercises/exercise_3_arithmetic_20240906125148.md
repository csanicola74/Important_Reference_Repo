# Exercise 3: Basic Arithmetic Operations

## Objective

Create a Python script that performs basic arithmetic operations.

## Instructions

1. Create a new Python file named `arithmetic.py`.
2. Declare two integer variables `num1` and `num2` with any values.
3. Perform the following operations:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division
   - Modulus
   - Exponentiation
4. Print the results of each operation.

## Example Output

`Addition: 15 Subtraction: 5 Multiplication: 50 Division: 2.5 Modulus: 0 Exponentiation: 100000`

## Tips

- Use appropriate operators for each operation.
- Test your script with different values to ensure it works correctly.
