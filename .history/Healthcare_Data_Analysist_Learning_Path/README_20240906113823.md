# Learning Pathway

Welcome to the **Healthcare Data Analysis Learning Path** repository! This pathway is designed to take you from a beginner to an advanced level in programming and data analysis, with a focus on real-world healthcare applications.

#### Overview

This learning pathway is divided into three levels: **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced**. Each level includes multiple modules that cover specific topics. You'll find hands-on exercises, practical examples, and references to deepen your understanding.
