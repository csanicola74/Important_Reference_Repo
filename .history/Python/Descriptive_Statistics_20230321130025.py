Measure of Central Tendency
Measure of central tendency is used to describe the middle/center value of the data.
Mean, Median, Mode are measures of central tendency.

1. Mean
Mean is the average value of the dataset.
Mean is calculated by adding all values in the dataset divided by the number of values in the dataset.
We can calculate the mean for only numerical variables

Mathematical Calculation

Mean calculation[Image by author]
Calculating Mean for a particular variable(“Age”) using Python.
df["Age"].mean()
Output: 28.333333333333332

Calculating the mean for all the columns in the dataframe.
df.mean()

Mean value for all columns
Calculated mean only for numerical datatype. “Gender” column in the dataset is excluded.

2. Median
The Median is the middle number in the dataset.
Median is the best measure when we have outliers.
Find the median of the “Age” column in our dataset.

Mathematical Calculation


Find the median
If we have an even number of data, find the average of the middle two items.

Example:
Age → 4, 12, 24, 8, 16, 20
Sort → 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24
Pick the middles ones → 12, 16
Find the average → 28/2 = 14

Calculating the median for a particular variable(“Age”) using Python.

df["Age"].median()
Output: 28

Calculating the median for all the columns in the dataframe.

df.median()

The median value for all columns
Calculated median only for the numerical datatype. The “Gender” column in the dataset is excluded.

3. Mode
The mode is used to find the common number in the dataset.

Calculating mode for a particular variable(“Age”) using a mathematical calculation


Calculating the mode for a particular variable(“Age”) using Python.

df["Age"].mode()

Mode
Calculating the mode for all the columns in the dataframe.
df.mode()

Mode
Here, in bmi column, all numbers are unique. So, all numbers are displayed.
Weight column, 70.0, and 80.0 are repeated more times, so both are displayed.

Measure of spread
The measure of spread/dispersion is used to describe how data is spread. It also describes the variability of the dataset.
Standard Deviation, Variance, Range, IQR, are used to describe the measure of spread/dispersion
The measure of spread can be shown in graphs like boxplot.
1.Variance
Variance is used to describe how far each number in the dataset is from the mean.

Formula to calculate population variance


Population Variance[Image by Author]
σ2 — Population Variance
μ - Population Mean
N - Total number of data in the dataset.

Calculating variance for “Age” column in the dataset

df["Age"].var()
Output: 5.5

Calculating variance for all columns in the dataframe

df.var()

Variance
Calculated variance only for numeric data types. The “Gender” column is excluded.

2.Standard Deviation
Standard Deviation is the measure of the spread of data from the mean.
Standard deviation is the square root of variance.
More the standard deviation, more the spread.
Calculating the standard deviation for “Age” column in the dataset

df["Age"].std()
Output: 2.345207879911715

Calculating the standard deviation for all columns in the dataset.

df.std()

Standard Deviation
3.Range
The range is the difference between the largest number and the smallest number
Larger the range, the more the dispersion.
Calculating the range of “Age” column in the dataset

m1 = df["Age"].max()
m1
# Output:32
m2 = df["Age"].min()
m2
# Output:25
range = m1-m2
range
# Output: 7
4. Interquartile range(IQR)
Quartiles describe the spread of data by breaking into quarters. The median exactly divides the data into two parts.
Q1(Lower quartile) is the middle value in the first half of the sorted dataset.
Q2 - is the median value
Q3(Upper quartile) is the middle value in the second half of the sorted dataset
The interquartile range is the difference between the 75th percentile(Q3) and the 25th percentile(Q1).
50 % of data fall within this range.
Calculating IQR for “Age” column in the dataset.

Q1 = df["Age"].quantile(0.25)
Q1
# Output : 27.0
Q3 = df["Age"].quantile(0.75)
Q3
# Output: 30.0
IQR = Q3-Q1
IQR
# Output: 3.0
describe()
describe() function generates descriptive statistics.It is used to view some basic statistical details like mean, median, min, max, percentiles, count of a dataframe, or series of numeric values.

Series
df["Age"].describe()

describe()
2. Dataframe

df.describe()

describe()
25 % → Q1-Lower quartile
50 % → Median
75 % → Q3-Upper quartile

3. include =”all”
All columns of the input will be included in the output.

df.describe(include="all")

df.describe(include=”all”)
Five-point summary
The five-point summary consists of five values

Minimum value
Q1 - Lower quartile
Median
Q3-Upper quartile
Maximum value
Statistical Plots
Statistical plots are used to identify outliers, visualize distributions, discover relationships, and the correlation between variables in a dataset.

Boxplots
Boxplot is used to describe how the data is distributed in the dataset. This graph represents five-point summary(minimum, maximum, median, lower quartile, and upper quartile). This graph is used to identify outliers.

whiskers — denote the spread of data
box — represents the IQR - 50 % of data lies within this range
df.boxplot(column="Age")
Output:


Box plot
Explaining the boxplot


Details of Box plot
In the “Age” category, no outliers are there.

Boxplot grouped by gender category
df.boxplot(column="Age", by="Gender")

Boxplot grouped by gender
Here we have an outlier in the “Male” category.

Let’s calculate a five-point summary for “Age” under “Male” category

Calculating Mean of “Age” of Male alone.
df1 = df.set_index("Gender")
df2 = df1.loc["Male", "Age"]
df2.mean()
# Output: 28.0
Calculating Q1, Q3, and IQR
q1 = df2.quantile(0.25)
print("Q1 :", q1)
q3 = df2.quantile(0.75)
print("Q3 :", q3)
IQR = q3-q1
print("IQR :", IQR
Output:

Q1: 27.0
Q3: 28.75
IQR: 1.75
Calculate the length of the upper whisker

The length of the upper whisker is the largest value that is no greater than the third quartile(Q3) plus 1.5 times the interquartile range(IQR)

whisker=(IQR*1.5)+Q3
print("Length of Upper Whisker :", whisker)
# Output:Length of Upper Whisker : 31.375
The length of the upper whisker should not be greater than 31.375
Age of Male → 25, 27, 28, 29, 32, 27

32 falls above the upper whisker range. So, it's an outlier.
So the length of the upper whisker is taken as 29(second maximum) which falls under the upper whisker range.

Visualizing distributions of data
Plotting univariate distributions
Histogram

This plot will show the distribution of univariate(single variable).
A histogram is a bar plot where the axis representing the data variable is divided into a set of discrete bins and the count of observations falling within each bin is shown using the height of the corresponding bar.
Histogram → plotting variable vs their count/frequencies in each bin.
Different ways to plot a histogram
Using pandas
Histogram for all columns in the dataframe

df.hist()

Histogram
Histogram for a particular column “Age”
df["Age"].hist()

Histogram
In the above graph, only age 27 appears twice, so the count of age 27 is shown as 2. Remaining all ages appear once only. So all other age count is shown as 1.

Choosing the bin size
df["Age"].hist(bins=20)

Histogram
2. Using matplotlib
plt.hist(df["Age"])

Histogram
Plotting Multivariate distribution
Pairplot or Scatterplot

Pairplot is used to describe pairwise relationships in a dataset. Pairplot is used to visualize the univariate distribution of all variables in a dataset along with all of their pairwise relationships.
The diagonal plots are histograms and all the other plots are scatter plots.

sns.pairplot(df)
