# Statistical Analysis System (SAS)

SAS can perform the following tasks:

1. It allows you to enter, retrieve and manage your data easily
2. It can read data from various external sources (Excel, CSV, Text files, Databases, Webpage etc)
3. You can explore and manipulate data in SAS.
4. It can analyze your data statistically and mathematically. Includes various statistical techniques.
5. It can generate beautiful graphs and tables.
6. You can run SQL queries on SAS datasets.
7. You can automate repetitive tasks with SAS Macros.
8. It can develop entirely new software applications.

## Basic SAS Program:

- `data example1;`: This line initiates a data step and creates a new dataset named "example1" to store the data.
- `input name $ ID;`: This line defines the variables for the dataset. It specifies that there are two variables: "name" and "ID." The dollar sign ($) after "name" indicates that it is a character variable, and the lack of a dollar sign after "ID" indicates that it is a numeric variable.
- `cards;`: This keyword signals the start of inline data. The data enclosed between `cards;` and the next semicolon (`;`) will be read as input data for the dataset.
- The lines following `cards;` contain the actual data values. Each line represents one observation (row) in the dataset. In this example, there are four observations with two variables each: "name" and "ID."
- `proc print;`: This line initiates the `proc print` procedure, which is used to display the contents of a dataset.
- `run;`: This line signifies the end of the data step and the end of the `proc print` procedure.

## Libraries

SAS files are stored in a SAS library. A SAS library is simply a collection of SAS files (data sets) that are stored in a folder. SAS files are stored either temporarily or permanently. By default, it is stored in a temporary library called `Work`.
