# Statistical Analysis System (SAS)

SAS can perform the following tasks:

1. It allows you to enter, retrieve and manage your data easily
2. It can read data from various external sources (Excel, CSV, Text files, Databases, Webpage etc)
3. You can explore and manipulate data in SAS.
4. It can analyze your data statistically and mathematically. Includes various statistical techniques.
5. It can generate beautiful graphs and tables.
6. You can run SQL queries on SAS datasets.
7. You can automate repetitive tasks with SAS Macros.
8. It can develop entirely new software applications.

- `data example1;`: This line initiates a data step and creates a new dataset named "example1" to store the data.
- `input name $ ID;`: This line defines the variables for the dataset. It specifies that there are two variables: "name" and "ID." The dollar sign ($) after "name" indicates that it is a character variable, and the lack of a dollar sign after "ID" indicates that it is a numeric variable.
- `cards;`: This keyword signals the start of inline data. The data enclosed between `cards;` and the next semicolon (`;`) will be read as input data for the dataset.
- The lines following `cards;` contain the actual data values. Each line represents one observation (row) in the dataset. In this example, there are four observations with two variables each: "name" and "ID."
- `proc print;`: This line initiates the `proc print` procedure, which is used to display the contents of a dataset.
- `run;`: This line signifies the end of the data step and the end of the `proc print` procedure.

## Libraries

SAS files are stored in a SAS library. A SAS library is simply a collection of SAS files (data sets) that are stored in a folder. SAS files are stored either temporarily or permanently. By default, it is stored in a temporary library called `Work`.

![1715180805241](image/SAS_notes/1715180805241.png)

### How to create a SAS library

1. **Temporary :** When you don't specify a library name at all, then the file is stored in a temporary SAS library called `Work`. When you close out the SAS session in which you created the SAS file, the temporary library and all of its files are removed from your computer's memory.

> data example;

_In this case, example is a data set that is stored in `Work` library._ **Note :** You can specify the library name Work followed by **dot (.)** and then data set name.

> data work.example;

2. **Permanent :** If you use a library name other than the default library name 'Work' when creating a SAS file, then the file is stored permanently until you delete it. That is, you can use permanent SAS libraries and their contents in subsequent SAS sessions.

You can specify the library name followed by **dot (.) sign** and then data set name.

> data mydata.example;

_In this case, example1 is a data set that is stored in **mydata** library._

## SAS Programming Rules

When it comes to programming in SAS, there are several best practices and rules that can help improve code readability, efficiency, and maintainability. Here are some important SAS programming rules to keep in mind:

### I. Rules for SAS statements

1. All SAS statements (except those containing data) must end with a **semicolon (;)** .
   > **Example :** "DATA example1 **;** " is an example of a SAS statement.
2. Any number of SAS statements can appear on a single line provided they are separated by a **semicolon** .
   > **Example :** "DATA example1; Input Name $ ID;" is an example of a SAS statement.
3. SAS statements typically begin with a SAS keyword. (DATA, PROC)
4. SAS statements are not case sensitive, that is, they can be entered in lowercase, uppercase, or a mixture of the two.
   > **Example :** SAS keywords (DATA, PROC) are not case sensitive
5. A delimited comment begins with a forward slash-asterisk (/_) and ends with an asterisk-forward slash (_/). All text within the delimiters is ignored by SAS.

### II. Rules for SAS names

- All names must contain between 1 and 32 characters.
- The first character appearing in a name must be a letter (A, B, ...Z, a, b, ... z) or an underscore (\_). Subsequent characters must be letters, numbers, or underscores. That is, no other characters, such as $, %, or & are permitted. Blanks also cannot appear in SAS names.
- SAS names are not case sensitive, that is, they can be entered in lowercase, uppercase, or a mixture of the two. (SAS is only case sensitive within quotation marks.)

### III. Rules for SAS variables

> If the variable in the **INPUT** statement is followed by a dollar sign ( **$** ), SAS assumes this is a character variable. Otherwise, the variable is considered as a numeric variable.

## Difference between PROC and DATA Step

**DATA STEP**Any portion of a SAS program that begins with a **DATA statement** and ends with a RUN statement is called a **DATA Step** .

DATA steps are used to manage data. In detail, DATA steps are used to read raw or external data into a SAS data set, to modify data values, and to subset or merge data sets.

**PROC (Procedure)** Any portion of a SAS program that begins with a **PROC statement** and ends with a RUN statement is called a **PROC Step or Procedures** .

PROC steps are in-built programs that allow us to analyze the data contained in a SAS data set. PROC steps are used to calculate descriptive statistics, to generate summary reports, and to create summary graphs and charts.

## Importing Data

### Syntax : PROC IMPORT

Syntax of PROC IMPORT is defined below -

```
PROC IMPORT DATAFILE=FileName OUT=SASDatasetName
DBMS=identifier REPLACE;
GETNAMES=Yes;
RUN;
```

Arguments of PROC IMPORT : Explanation

1. **DATAFILE:** Specify the location of the file to be imported.
2. **OUT:** Specify the name to assign to the dataset after it is imported into SAS
3. **DBMS:** Define the format of the file being imported. Some of the common values are CSV, EXCEL, TAB, DLM, ACCESS.
4. **REPLACE:** Determine whether to replace the existing SAS Dataset. Yes/No.
5. **GETNAMES:** Specify whether to use the first row as variable names. By default it it YES. If you set the option as NO, it will tell SAS not to use the first row of data as variable names. In this case SAS assigns variable names as VAR1, VAR2, VAR3 if there are 3 variables.

File Formats supported in PROC IMPORT

Following is a list of file extensions supported in PROC IMPORT. Specify the value in `DBMS=identifier`option

| Identifier | Output Data Source                | Extension                |

| EXCEL      | Supports all versions of MS Excel | .xls, .xlsx, xlsb, .xlsm |
| ACCESS     | Microsoft Access 2000 and later   | .mdb                     |
| SAV        | SPSS file                         | .sav                     |
| DTA        | Stata File                        | .dta                     |
| JMP        | JMP files                         | .jmp                     |

### Use PROC IMPORT to Import CSV File

Let's take a simple example to import CSV (comma-separated values) file into SAS. Here we have data named `data.csv` which has 3 variables and 5 observations. Column names are ID, Name, Score. Data looks like the image below. You can open CSV file in Notepad.

[![PROC IMPORT - SAS](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMkgMa1yZJKs7awP9kNGsLz9wcpqR2-Qr1lILKKKZAkhFO_DkAPSRWYd0HU3IUdRs6dEfslPQtFbztMeASShS-q9apzdaBF7B-0Jjie1Ff-Zvlc8onOZxkTl-Ml5I0RhetQp-zVGcX8-aTGSHCnGl2iZkte32ivg76iP3ufYxfHOkgf6hxfC2i1aHhuw/s1600-rw/csv.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMkgMa1yZJKs7awP9kNGsLz9wcpqR2-Qr1lILKKKZAkhFO_DkAPSRWYd0HU3IUdRs6dEfslPQtFbztMeASShS-q9apzdaBF7B-0Jjie1Ff-Zvlc8onOZxkTl-Ml5I0RhetQp-zVGcX8-aTGSHCnGl2iZkte32ivg76iP3ufYxfHOkgf6hxfC2i1aHhuw/s1600/csv.png)

`DBMS=CSV` tells SAS that the file being imported is a CSV file.

```
PROC IMPORT DATAFILE='/home/deepanshu88us0/data.csv'
	DBMS=CSV
	OUT=WORK.READIN;
	GETNAMES=YES;
RUN;
```

The above SAS Program creates a SAS dataset named **READIN** in the temporary library ( **WORK** ).

```
NOTE: WORK.READIN data set was successfully created.
NOTE: The data set WORK.READIN has 5 observations and 3 variables.
```

Output

To see the imported file in **RESULTS** window, you can use `PROC PRINT` procedure. See the SAS program below.

```
PROC PRINT DATA=WORK.READIN;
RUN;
```

# Personal Notes

1. SAS is opened in a browser window and doesnt have its own seperate application to interact with
2. To start a new sas program (aka where you are going to write the code to do anything within SAS), you would click on the new icon under the "Files and Folders" option on the left-hand side of the browser. It is the first icon and looks like a square with an asteriks in the upper right hand corner
3. In order to add comments to your code in SAS you would put the text in between /\* \*/ which can be created easily with the shortcut ctrl+/
4.
