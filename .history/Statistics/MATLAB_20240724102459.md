# MATLAB

MATLAB is a powerful programming and numeric computing platform widely used in healthcare for data analysis due to its robust capabilities in handling large datasets, performing complex statistical analyses, and creating visualizations. For data analysts in healthcare, MATLAB facilitates the processing and analysis of patient data, medical imaging, and clinical trial results. It supports the development of predictive models, the implementation of machine learning algorithms, and the integration of various data sources, helping to uncover patterns and insights that can improve patient outcomes, optimize treatments, and advance medical research. Its extensive library of toolboxes and functions tailored for healthcare applications makes MATLAB an invaluable tool for efficiently managing and analyzing medical data.

# MATLAB Onramp Tutorial

- The equal sign (`=`) in MATLAB is the _assignment_ operator, meaning that the value of the expression on the right of the equal sign is assigned to the variable on the left.
- adding a semicolon at the end of the statement won't show the results but the result will be in the workspace
- You can name your MATLAB variables anything you'd like as long as they **start** with a letter and contain only letters, numbers, and underscores (\_).
- You can save variables in your workspace to a MAT-file, a file format specific to MATLAB, by using the 'save' command:
  - `save filename`
- you can remove all the variables from your workspace with the `clear` command and use the command `clc` to clean up the Command Window
- to load variables from a MAT-file, use the `load` command
  - `load filename`
- you can see the contents of any variable by entering the name of the variable in the command window:
  - `myvar`
- to load or save only _some_ of your variables, you can use additional inputs with the commands:
  - ex: `load myData k` will load just the variable k; then `save justk k` will save just the variable k to a new MAT-file names `justk.mat`
- there are built-in constants, such as pi to represent Ï€ (`a = pi`)
