# MATLAB

MATLAB is a powerful programming and numeric computing platform widely used in healthcare for data analysis due to its robust capabilities in handling large datasets, performing complex statistical analyses, and creating visualizations. For data analysts in healthcare, MATLAB facilitates the processing and analysis of patient data, medical imaging, and clinical trial results. It supports the development of predictive models, the implementation of machine learning algorithms, and the integration of various data sources, helping to uncover patterns and insights that can improve patient outcomes, optimize treatments, and advance medical research. Its extensive library of toolboxes and functions tailored for healthcare applications makes MATLAB an invaluable tool for efficiently managing and analyzing medical data.

# MATLAB Onramp Tutorial

- The equal sign (`=`) in MATLAB is the _assignment_ operator, meaning that the value of the expression on the right of the equal sign is assigned to the variable on the left.
- adding a semicolon at the end of the statement won't show the results but the result will be in the workspace
- You can name your MATLAB variables anything you'd like as long as they **start** with a letter and contain only letters, numbers, and underscores (\_).
- You can save variables in your workspace to a MAT-file, a file format specific to MATLAB, by using the 'save' command:
  - `save filename`
- you can remove all the variables from your workspace with the `clear` command and use the command `clc` to clean up the Command Window
- to load variables from a MAT-file, use the `load` command
  - `load filename`
- you can see the contents of any variable by entering the name of the variable in the command window:
  - `myvar`
- to load or save only _some_ of your variables, you can use additional inputs with the commands:
  - ex: `load myData k` will load just the variable k; then `save justk k` will save just the variable k to a new MAT-file names `justk.mat`
- there are built-in constants, such as pi to represent Ï€ (`a = pi`), abs to represent absolute value and eig to represent eigenvalues
- For long vectors, entering individual numbers is not practical. An alternative, shorthand method for creating evenly spaced vectors is to use the colon operator (:) and specify only the start and end values.
  - y=5:8
  - y= 5 6 7 8
  - Notice that square brackets are not needed when you use the : operator.
- If you know the number of elements you want in a vector (instead of the spacing between each element), you can use the `linspace` function
  - `linspace(first,last,number_of_elements)`
  - You also need to use commas (,) to separate inputs to the linspace function
- Both `linspace ` and the `:` operator create row vectors. But what if you need a linearly spaced column vector? The transpose operator (`'`) converts a row vector to a column vector.
- You can create column vectors in a single command by creating the row vector and transposing it all on one line. Use parentheses to specify the order of operations.
  - x=(1:2:5)'
  - x= 1
    - 3
    - 5
- MATLAB contains many functions that create commonly used mastrices, such as matrices of random numbers
  - x = rand(2)
  - x =
    - 0.8147 0.1270
    - 0.9058 0.9134
- Many matrix creation functions allow you to input one number to create a square matrix ( _n_ -by- _n_ ) or input two numbers to create a rectangular matrix ( _m_ -by- _n_ ).
  - Most array creation functions accept the same inputs as rand. For example, the zeros and ones functions create matrices of all zeros and all ones, respectively
- How do you determine the size of an existing matrix? You can use the `size` function.
  - size(x)
- You can also create a matrix with the same size as an existing matrix in one line of code.
  - rand(size(x))
- You can extract values from an array using _row-column indexing_ .
  - y=A(5,7)
  - This syntax extracts the value in the `5`th row and `7`th column of `A` and assigns the result to the variable `y`.
- You can also use the MATLAB keyword `end` as either a row or column index to reference the last element
  - and this can even be done arithmetic for example if you wanted the second to last or third to last variable you can do `end-1`
- When used as an index, the colon operator (`:`) specifies all the elements in that dimension. For example, this code creates a column vector containing all the elements from the first column of `A`.
  - x=A(:,1)
- the .\* operator performs element-wise multiplication by multiplying the corresponding elements of two equally sized arrays
  - z = [3 4] .\* [10 20]
- you can also request two output variables fromt he size function. In this case, each variable contains the size of one fo the dimensions of the input array. Use square brackets ([]) to request more than one output
  - [xrow,xcol] = size(x)
- you can plot two vectors of the same length against each other using the `plot` function
  - you can also change the colors, lines, and markers of the plots
    - [Documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/plot.html#btzitot_sep_mw_3a76f056-2882-44d7-8e73-c695c0c54ca8)
- when you plot a single vector by itself, MATLAB uses the vector values as the y-axis data and sets the x-axis data to the range of 1 to n (the number of elements in the vector)
- Relational operators, such as >, <, == and ~= perform comparisons between two values. The outcome of a comparison for equality or inequality is either `1` (`true`) or `0` (`false`).
- You can use logical indexing to reassign values in an array. For example, to replace all values in the array x that are equal to 999 with the value 1, use this syntax:
  - x(x==999) = 1
- You can combine logical comparisons by using the logical operators AND (&) and OR (|)
- Instead of typing a different column value, you can use a slider to select any column in spectra
