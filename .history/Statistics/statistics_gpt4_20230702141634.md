# Statistics for Healthcare

Let's think about your favorite music playlist. Imagine that each song's length in minutes is a piece of data. Statistics is like a super cool DJ mixing all this data to create a meaningful picture.

1.**Average (Mean)**: This is like figuring out the "typical" length of a song in your playlist. Add up all the song lengths, then divide by the number of songs. Voila, you've got your average!

2.**Median**: This is the middle song length if you line them all up from shortest to longest. If you have an odd number of songs, it's easy peasy, just pick the one in the middle. If it's even, you'll have to take the average of the two middle songs.

3.**Mode**: This one's the length that appears most often. If most of your songs are 3 minutes long, then 3 is your mode.

4.**Range**: The difference between the longest and shortest song in your playlist.

5.**Standard Deviation**: This one's a bit trickier. Think of it as a measure of how much your songs' lengths "deviate" or vary from the average length.
