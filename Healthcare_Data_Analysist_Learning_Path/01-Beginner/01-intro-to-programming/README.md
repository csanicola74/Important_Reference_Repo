# Introduction to Programming

Welcome to the "Introduction to Programming" module! This section is designed to help you build a solid foundation in Python programming. You'll learn the basics of Python syntax, variables, basic operators, and how to handle input and output. These are essential building blocks for any programming task, particularly in data analysis.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand and write basic Python syntax.
- Use variables to store and manipulate data.
- Perform basic arithmetic and logical operations.
- Use input and output functions to interact with users.

## What You Will Learn

1. **Python Syntax**
   - How to write and execute Python code.
   - Understanding indentation and its importance in Python.
2. **Variables and Data Types**
   - Different data types in Python: integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
   - Declaring and using variables.
3. **Basic Operators**
   - Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`.
   - Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
   - Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`.
4. **Input and Output**
   - Using the `input()` function to take user input.
   - Using the `print()` function to display output.

## Getting Started

1. Start by reading through the `basic_syntax.py` file to understand the basic concepts.
2. Complete the exercises in the `exercises/` folder to practice what you've learned.
3. Refer to the additional resources section for further reading.

## Prerequisites

No prior programming experience is required. All you need is a text editor (like VS Code or PyCharm) and Python installed on your computer.

## Exercises

- Complete the exercises in the `exercises/` folder:
  - [Exercise 1: Hello World](./exercises/exercise_1_hello_world.md)
  - [Exercise 2: Working with Variables](./exercises/exercise_2_variables.md)
  - [Exercise 3: Basic Arithmetic Operations](./exercises/exercise_3_arithmetic.md)
